#This is the first practice I will get with this list and loop functions

#Make a list for the types of pizza I like
pizzas = ['cheese', 'pepperoni', 'italian sausage']

for pizza in pizzas:
    print(pizza)

for pizza in pizzas:
    print(f"I like {pizzas} pizza")

print("I will pick one of these pizzas before anything else")
