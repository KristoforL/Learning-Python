# Learning-Python
Learning Python basics and referencing content when working on projects

Assignments for the no scratch python book second edition are previewed by PW and number for regular projects.
I run these in vscode but if you would like to run all of the functions in this please have python 3.9 at least

If you have any questions or about the code or something is not working please by all means contribute or leave a comment and I will get back to you on it or fix it. 

# TO USE:

Download the zip and run programs as wanted. Each file will have a brief description of what it is trying to accomplish some notes as well as a break down of the how the code can be manipulated based on use case. 

***All files not in a specific folder are for the use of FILE IO or showing data in the demonstration**
***I am still working on organizing the folder so that the files are in the best location, but some files will be created around the folder structure**

Beginner folder is strictly for basics that all python programmers should understand when first starting out.

Intermediate folder is for loops and more advanced concepts like File IO

Advanced folder contains functions, importing and unit testing
