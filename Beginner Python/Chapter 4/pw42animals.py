#This is basically another practice with list and looping through them but with animals.

#Declare a list of animals
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'hedgehog', 'monkey']

for animal in animals:
    print(animal)

for animal in animals:
    print(f"I really want a {animal}... so bad")

print("Any of these animals would make a great pet due to size and the cost associated with each.")
