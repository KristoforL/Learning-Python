#This is a practice code to show how to use the string modifiers to convert string to uppercase lower case or title case

#Declaring a variable 
#Set a second variable to test .lower() method
name = "kimbo"
name1 = "Kimbo"

#Printed all the variables and since they are strings they do not need to be in quotation marks
print(name.upper())
print(name1.lower())
print(name.title())
