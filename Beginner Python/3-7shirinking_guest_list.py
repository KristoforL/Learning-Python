#Declare a list
guest = ['jeremy', 'lorena', 'toni', 'granny', 'mom', 'kim', 'dad']

#I used the pop method at index 0 because as they print they remove the first index and reduce the list
print(f"Sorry {guest.pop(0)}, they just called back and said I can only have 2 guest. I will catch you back at your place.")
print(f"Sorry {guest.pop(0)}, they just called back and said I can only have 2 guest. I'd love you to meet them butt I want to meet them instead.")
