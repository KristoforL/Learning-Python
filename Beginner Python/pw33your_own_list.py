#This is a freestyle practice that will allow me to choose my fsvorite thing and print them in a statement.

#I will choose cars. The ones I have, the ones I had, and the ones I want
cars = ["saturn", "jeep", "tesla", "ford gt"]

#Print out statements about the cars in the list
print(f"Someone I nicknamed Doja loves {cars[1].title()}.I would love to gift them one.")
print(f"My first car was a {cars[0].title()}. I currently do not have that car as I totaled it.")
print(f"The next car I get will be a {cars[2].title()} model 3 or roadster. This will be my last car purchase until all I have to put a car down.")
print(f"I know that some people have a {cars[3].title()}, and they have all the road to themselves to speed.")
