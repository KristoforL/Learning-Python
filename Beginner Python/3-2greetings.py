#This is practice more with the list 

#Created a list of people I know from exercise 3-1
names = ["lorena", "toni", "lon", "kim", "brian"]

#This time though I will be printing a message to each person. I used an f-string so I get the index content and not just text to signify the index
print(f"Hello, {names[0].title()}. I hope that you are havint a better time than myself.")
print(f"Hello, {names[1].title()}. I hope that you are havint a better time than myself.")
print(f"Hello, {names[2].title()}. I hope that you are havint a better time than myself.")
print(f"Hello, {names[3].title()}. I hope that you are havint a better time than myself.")
print(f"Hello, {names[4].title()}. I hope that you are havint a better time than myself.")
