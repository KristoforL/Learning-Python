#This is practice to execute what was learned about list and what I can do with them as well as strings to use the value in them.

#Declare a list of people I want to have dinner with
guest = ['eric l', 'granny', 'kim', 'cookie']

#Personalize a message to them inviting them to the dinner with the list
print(f"Hey {guest[-1].title()}. I hope you are doing well. I am having a dinner and wanted to know if you were able to come?")
print(f"Yo {guest[0].title()}. I miss you and hope that you are really doing well. I know that you were not able to see me become an even better man. With my first car and house but will you join me for dinner soon.")
print(f"Hello {guest[1].title()} and {guest[-2].title()}. I know I am inviting you guys at the same time but I feel this must be done because you guys would benefit each other so well during this time.So would you guys join me for dinner soon?")
